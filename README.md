# Sort Array #

Hello fellow coders. This is me ### cp-aman ###. I have worked day and night to come with the idea of sorting an array (for real, trust me).  
I have uploaded the code in the repo..

My actions does the following -
1. Automatically adds labels to new issues.
2. Adds comments to pull requests
3. Tries to merge the PR to my repo.

Have fun reading it <3.
